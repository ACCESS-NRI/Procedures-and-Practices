# Welcome

All procedure and practice policies for [ACCESS-NRI] are available on this website. 

Policies are [markdown] documents in a [GitHub repository][repo] that are automatically rendered into HTML and viewable on the [Procedures and Practices website][procedures-and-practices]. 

These procedures and practices define the scope of what ACCESS-NRI does and how it does it. The policies are living documents, open to the community and feedback is welcome. Direct feedback is one avenue for the community to have a say in how the ACCESS-NRI operates. The best way to give feedback is to [open an issue][issues] on the [repository][repo].

The site contains pages for each procedure or practice policy document. These are grouped into broad sections, but the entire site is searchable which should make finding relevant material relatively painless.
